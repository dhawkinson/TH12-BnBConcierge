# Before you start

To prepare for this project you'll need to make sure you complete and understand these steps.

### Have a GitHub account and know how to create a new repository and upload files to it

  - As with the previous projects, you'll submit your finished work using GitHub

### Choose at least two APIs for your app and review the documentation
  - View a list of API suggestions in the project instructions and resources
### Sign up for hosting
You can choose one of the free hosting options listed in the Project Resources

If you’re building your app using Express and MondoDB, we recommend:
  - Heroku and mLab
  - or OpenShift

## Project Instructions
To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question on Slack or in the Treehouse Community.

### Set up your JavaScript-powered web app
Build your app using any of the technologies or application frameworks you've learned so far such as React, the MEAN Stack, Express, and Node.js
  - View a list of app ideas below the project instructions
  - Connect to at least two APIs
  - Display data from at least two other web sites by connecting to their API
### Front end design and layout
  - Use a responsive front end framework like Bootstrap to style your app
  - You can add your own custom CSS to give your app a unique look
### Manage your app's data with a database
  - Use a relational database like MySQL
  - Or use a document-based data store like MongoDB
### JSHint
Check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the project resources
JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems
You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful
### Github
Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account
See the workshop on Using GitHub for the Degree Program
### App portability
Your app should run successfully after running npm install and npm start in a local clone of the GitHub repository
### Deploy your project
  - Make your application available at a public URL, and submit the URL for review
  - See the resources section below for free hosting options
  - View Treehouse tutorials for deploying to Heroku, and using mLab for a MongoDB instance, in the project resources
### Project ideas:

  - Pull random popular hashtags from Twitter and display a corresponding gif using Giphy
  - Use Google Maps and weather forecast data to create an app that displays the forecast for an area on a map
  - Match a film with its soundtrack using the OMDb and Spotify APIs
  - Combine the Twitter API with Google Maps to create an app that displays location-specific information about any city where people actively use Twitter
  - Use the Yelp and Twitter API to build a recommendation app that serves users suggested local businesses based on activity on Twitter
  - Use Craigslist.org and weather forecast data to display the current weather of a pickup location
  - Combine Craigslist.org with Google Maps to get real-time traffic information about a pickup location
  - Show the point on a Google Map directly below the current position of the International Space Station

###NOTE: 
A good practice is to check your project for cross browser compatibility. Making sure that your app looks and functions correctly in multiple (at least three) browsers is an important part of being a top-notch developer. Leave a comment to the project reviewer about which browser(s) the project was checked to ensure they are seeing things as you have designed them.

Some browser options:

  - Google Chrome
  - Mozilla Firefox
  - Internet Explorer/Edge
  - Safari
### Extra Credit
To get an "exceeds" rating, complete all of the steps below:

  - Use more than two APIs in your app
  - Write custom CSS to layout and style your app further than the default Bootstrap style
  - Use HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and input is formatted correctly
  - Write unit tests for your code using Mocha.js and an assertion library like Chai
#### NOTE: Getting an "Exceed Expectations" grade.

  - See the rubric in the "How You'll Be Graded" tab above for details on what you need to receive an "Exceed Expectations" grade.
  - Passing grades are final. If you try for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade, but miss an item and receive a “Meets Expectations” grade, you won’t get a second chance. Exceptions can be made for items that have been misgraded in review.
  - Always mention in the comments of your submission or any resubmission, what grade you are going for. Some students want their project to be rejected if they do not meet all Exceeds Expectations Requirements, others will try for all the "exceeds" requirement but do not mind if they pass with a Meets Expectations grade. Leaving a comment in your submission will help the reviewer understand which grade you are specifically going for.

  ### NOTE:

  Add a disclaimer on the HTML5 validation when submitting.

  Howdy @theHawk! We try to be fairly liberal with the old capstone requirements so since you have validation using express-validator that will be fine. To avoid any confusion though I would suggest including a note in the submission notes when you submit the project that you reached out in Slack and were told that approach was ok.
